    Helper class for writing out FeatureSets to files on disk.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        A path to the feature file we would like to create. The suffix
        to this filename must be ``.arff``, ``.csv``, ``.jsonlines``,
        ``.libsvm``, ``.ndj``, or ``.tsv``. If ``subsets``
        is not ``None``, when calling the ``write()`` method, path is
        assumed to be a string containing the path to the directory to
        write the feature files with an additional file extension
        specifying the file type. For example ``/foo/.csv``.
    feature_set : skll.FeatureSet
        The ``FeatureSet`` instance to dump to the file.
    quiet : bool
        Do not print "Writing..." status message to stderr.
        Defaults to ``True``.
    subsets : dict (str to list of str)
        A mapping from subset names to lists of feature names
        that are included in those sets. If given, a feature
        file will be written for every subset (with the name
        containing the subset name as suffix to ``path``).
        Note, since string- valued features are automatically
        converted into boolean features with names of the form
        ``FEATURE_NAME=STRING_VALUE``, when doing the
        filtering, the portion before the ``=`` is all that's
        used for matching. Therefore, you do not need to
        enumerate all of these boolean feature names in your
        mapping.
        Defaults to ``None``.
    logger : logging.Logger
        A logger instance to use to log messages instead of creating
        a new one by default.
        Defaults to ``None``.
