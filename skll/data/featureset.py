class FeatureSet(object):

    """
    Encapsulation of all of the features, values, and metadata about a given
    set of data. This replaces ``ExamplesTuple`` from older versions of SKLL.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of this feature set.

    ids : np.array of shape (n_ids,)
        Example IDs for this set.

    labels : np.array of shape (n_labels,), default=None
        labels for this set.

    features : list of dict or an array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features), default=None
        The features for each instance represented as either a
        list of dictionaries or an array-like (if ``vectorizer`` is
        also specified).

    vectorizer : DictVectorizer or FeatureHasher, default=None
        Vectorizer which will be used to generate the feature matrix.

    Warnings
    --------
    FeatureSets can only be equal if the order of the instances is
    identical because these are stored as lists/arrays. Since scikit-learn's
    ``DictVectorizer`` automatically sorts the underlying feature matrix
    if it is sparse, we do not do any sorting before checking for equality.
    This is not a problem because we _always_ use sparse matrices with
    ``DictVectorizer`` when creating FeatureSets.

    Notes
    -----
    If ids, labels, and/or features are not None, the number of rows in
    each array must be equal.
