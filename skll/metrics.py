def kappa(y_true, y_pred, weights=None, allow_off_by_one=False):
    """
    Calculates the kappa inter-rater agreement between two the gold standard
    and the predicted ratings. Potential values range from -1 (representing
    complete disagreement) to 1 (representing complete agreement).  A kappa
    value of 0 is expected if all agreement is due to chance.

    In the course of calculating kappa, all items in ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` will
    first be converted to floats and then rounded to integers.

    It is assumed that y_true and y_pred contain the complete range of possible
    ratings.

    This function contains a combination of code from yorchopolis's kappa-stats
    and Ben Hamner's Metrics projects on Github.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array-like of float
        The true/actual/gold labels for the data.
    y_pred : array-like of float
        The predicted/observed labels for the data.
    weights : str or np.array, optional
        Specifies the weight matrix for the calculation.
        Options are ::

            -  None = unweighted-kappa
            -  'quadratic' = quadratic-weighted kappa
            -  'linear' = linear-weighted kappa
            -  two-dimensional numpy array = a custom matrix of

        weights. Each weight corresponds to the
        :math:`w_{ij}` values in the wikipedia description
        of how to calculate weighted Cohen's kappa.
        Defaults to None.
    allow_off_by_one : bool, optional
        If true, ratings that are off by one are counted as
        equal, and all other differences are reduced by
        one. For example, 1 and 2 will be considered to be
        equal, whereas 1 and 3 will have a difference of 1
        for when building the weights matrix.
        Defaults to False.

    Returns
    -------
    k : float
        The kappa score, or weighted kappa score.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If ``y_true`` != ``y_pred``.
