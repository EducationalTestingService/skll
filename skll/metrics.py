def kappa(y_true, y_pred, weights=None, allow_off_by_one=False):
    """
    Calculates the kappa inter-rater agreement between two the gold standard
    and the predicted ratings. Potential values range from -1 (representing
    complete disagreement) to 1 (representing complete agreement).  A kappa
    value of 0 is expected if all agreement is due to chance.

    In the course of calculating kappa, all items in `y_true` and `y_pred` will
    first be converted to floats and then rounded to integers.

    It is assumed that y_true and y_pred contain the complete range of possible
    ratings.

    This function contains a combination of code from yorchopolis's kappa-stats
    and Ben Hamner's Metrics projects on Github.

    :param y_true: The true/actual/gold labels for the data.
    :type y_true: array-like of float
    :param y_pred: The predicted/observed labels for the data.
    :type y_pred: array-like of float
    :param weights: Specifies the weight matrix for the calculation.
                    Options are:

                        -  None = unweighted-kappa
                        -  'quadratic' = quadratic-weighted kappa
                        -  'linear' = linear-weighted kappa
                        -  two-dimensional numpy array = a custom matrix of
                           weights. Each weight corresponds to the
                           :math:`w_{ij}` values in the wikipedia description
                           of how to calculate weighted Cohen's kappa.

    :type weights: str or numpy array
    :param allow_off_by_one: If true, ratings that are off by one are counted as
                             equal, and all other differences are reduced by
                             one. For example, 1 and 2 will be considered to be
                             equal, whereas 1 and 3 will have a difference of 1
                             for when building the weights matrix.
