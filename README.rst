This Python package provides utilities to make it easier to run
machine learning experiments with scikit-learn.

Command-line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``run_experiment`` is a command-line utility for running a series of learners on
datasets specified in a configuration file. For more information about using
run_experiment (including a quick example), go
`here <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/run_experiment.html>`__.

Python API
~~~~~~~~~~

If you just want to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate learning code, you can
use our simple Python API. The main way you'll want to use the API is through
the ``load_examples`` function and the ``Learner`` class. For more details on
how to simply train, test, cross-validate, and run grid search on a variety of
scikit-learn models see
`the documentation <https://skll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__.

A Note on Pronunciation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SciKit-Learn Laboratory (SKLL) is pronounced "skull": that's where the learning
happens.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Python 2.7+
-  `scikit-learn <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`__
-  `six <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`__
-  `PrettyTable <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PrettyTable>`__
-  `BeautifulSoup 4 <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`__
-  `ML Metrics <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ml_metrics/0.1.2>`__
-  `Grid Map <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gridmap>`__ (only required if you plan
   to run things in parallel on a DRMAA-compatible cluster)

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

-  v0.9.4

   +  Documentation fixes
   +  Added requirements.txt to manifest to fix broken PyPI release tarball.

-  v0.9.3

   +  Fixed bug with merging feature sets that used to cause a crash.
   +  If you're running scikit-learn 0.14+, we use their StandardScaler, since
      the bug fix we include in FixedStandardScaler is in there.
   +  Unit tests all pass again
   +  Lots of little things related to using travis (which do not affect users)

-  v0.9.2

   +  Fixed example.cfg path issue. Updated some documentation.
   +  Made path in make_example_iris_data.py consistent with the updated one
      in example.cfg

-  v0.9.1

   +  Fixed bug where classification experiments would raise an error about class
      labels not being floats
   +  Updated documentation to include quick example for run_experiment.
